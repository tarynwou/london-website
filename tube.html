<h1>How To Use It</h1>
<p>You will most likely need an Oyster card to get around on the Tube. It is a prepaid card used to pay for public transit in London. Get one as soon as you get to London, you will not regret it! As well, make sure to look out for the station signs.</p>
<br>

<p>
<b>Fun Fact:</b> The Tube system could’ve actually been water-based and people would’ve had to float down a stream to get from station to station! Isn't that rubbish!

<h1>Common Train Warnings</h1>
<p>While travelling on the Tube, you are bound to hear a few of these phrases.</p>
<ul>
	<li>“Mind the gap” —and sometimes you really do have to mind the gap!
</li>
    <li>“Please stand clear of the doors”—or people will shove you out of the way!
</li>
    <li>“Please mind the doors”—you really should.
</li>
    <li>“This train is now ready for depart”—so you better get on!</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h1>Tips</h1>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>Check for any line closures before you start travelling</li>
    <li>Don’t breathe in the air too much at the back of any of the trains! There are oodles of nasty particles back there that will turn the inside of your nose black.</li>
    <li>Rush Hours: 7:30-9:30 in the morning and 17:00-19:00 (5:00-7:00) in the evening</li>
    <li>Have your ticket/Oyster card out before you cross the barrier, it can be very busy there and you do not want to be the person who clogs the system!</li>
    <li>Keep your personal belongings close, pickpocketing is not uncommon.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<b>Fun Fact:</b> Did you know? You can take the Tube all the way to France!
