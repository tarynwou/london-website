<p>If you are planning on taking a trip to London, here are a few things you should know!</p>
<ul>
	<li>Always stay to the right of an escalator if you are not walking up. It is just courtesy because everyone in London is busy, so leave them some space to speed up their travel time.</li>
    <li>If you are coming from a place where cars drive on the right side of the road, you’re in for a game changer. Always check both ways TWICE before you cross a street. You will thank me later when you have still not been hit by a bus.
</li>
    <li>Get accustomed to reading military time because that is how most time is displayed in London!
</li>
    <li>Tipping is not mandatory! Most places will include a “tip” in the bill already. Small tips are still appreciated though.
</li>
    <li>Remember that sometimes, it’s quicker to walk than to tube (see more details about the Tube here).</li>
    <li>When meeting locals, it is proper to shake hands and respond to any introduction with “Pleased to meet you.”
</li>
    <li>Open the doors for others, it is the polite thing to do!</li>
</ul>
<br>

<b>Fun Fact:</b> For those of you North Americans, there is one road in London where driving on the right side of the road is mandatory.
